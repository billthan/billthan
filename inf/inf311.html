                    </h3>
                    <a>

                        <p>
                            How is the idea of information constructed through cultural representation? How do
                            imaginative works provoke us to think about information technologies? This course surveys
                            the cultural history of the idea of information, from its historical roots to present-day
                            representations in popular culture, drawing on film, television, video games, literature,
                            art, advertising, performance, and other media.

                        ASSIGNMENT #4 STORY: Information Culture Playlist featuring <i>Breaking Bad</i> and <i>Borat The
                            Subsequent Moviefilm</i>
                    </h3>
                    <p>For the third assignment in INF311, students were to write a 2700-3000 word essay on including 2
                        or more creative works that should be included on the information culture playlists. These works
                        are essential for viewing/reading/playing/listening/etc. to a course like INF311.</p>

                    <br>
                    <h4>
                        <i>Breaking Bad</i> and Symbolism
                    </h4>
                    <p>
                        Firstly, <i>Breaking Bad</i> is filled with symbolism. Walter White and his fellow characters
                        are all
                        shrouded in symbolism. We can see that Walter White wears different colours throughout
                        <i>Breaking Bad</i>. Furthermore, Walter’s alter ego Heisenberg is an important symbol to
                        foreshadow events to come. Symbols are important, especially when studying them in information
                        culture. They are deeply rooted in us as we develop as children.

                    <h4>
                        <i>Borat 2</i>, the Pandemic and 2020 Election
                    </h4>
                    <p>
                        Secondly,  <i>Borat 2</i>is straight off the press of the 2020 pandemic. At the time of writing, we are
                        still living in this situation. Borat is not afraid to poke fun at the pandemic, anti-maskers,
                        Trump supporters, and most importantly the American people. This film is in touch with what
                        everyone lives in the moment and is not afraid to point out the unjust in our information
                        culture right now.

                    <h4>
                        Satirial Literacy </h4>
                    <p>
                        Lastly, I will incorporate both pieces together and argue that the satire used in both pieces is
                        what makes both pieces so enjoyable to watch. The satire in <i>Breaking Bad</i> makes Walter White’s
                        life entirely ironic. Viewers enjoy this as we know that Walter’s life could never happen. On
                        the other hand, the satire in <i>Borat 2</i> is outrageous. There could never be a character like
                        Borat, or a country like Kazakhstan in <i>Borat 2</i>. These things are funny because they are
                        unreasonable. The satirical knowledge required in both <i>Breaking Bad</i> and <i>Borat 2</i> makes both
                        creative pieces important for our information culture.
