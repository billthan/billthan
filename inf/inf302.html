                    <a>

                        <p>
                            This course explores how society, culture, and understanding of the human condition
                            influence, and are influenced by, technological development. It focuses on the study of
                            interdependent and institutionalized systems of law, economics, culture and technology,
                            exploring the conditions of stability and instability in these systems. We will survey the
                            available theories and methods for understanding large scale socio-technological systems.
                        </p>

                        ASSIGNMENT #4 STORY: The Limits of Social Constructivism in STS
                    </h3>
                    <p>For the third assignment in INF302, we were tasked with reading response that demonstrates our
                        knowledge of the texts and provides a critical and formal reflection on a weekly theme (in the
                        course). This would be achieved through comparative analysis of the readings. For
                        this assignment, we wrote a 1200-1500 word response to one of the required readings assigned in
                        this course. The response should cover the following:</p>
                    <br>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Introduction that includes an overview of the required reading selected, plus a preview of
                            the main arguments.
                        </li>
                        <li>Review and comparison of the selected reading with the additional academic literature
                            gathered
                        </li>
                        <li>A clear description of your response – i.e. argument(s) or position(s) on key
                            arguments/tensions was identified in the course reading. The response should be firmly
                            grounded in theory, previous arguments, and/or research findings derived from peer-reviewed
                            academic works.
                        </li>
                        <li>A conclusion that summarizes the main points and suggests a way forward or
                            some other form of recommendation for future students of this course.
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                    <h4>
                        Sismondo and Social Constructivism
                    </h4>
                    <p>
                        I chose to write my assignment on Sismondo’s Chapter 6, "The Social Construction of Scientific
                        and Technical Realities" in his book <i>Introduction to Science and Technology Studies</i>.
                        Sismondo
                        argues that social constructivism provides three important assumptions for STS. Firstly, STS is
                        social. Secondly, STS is active. Thirdly, the products of STS are natural. I will take on each
                        of these points and provide my thoughts and arguments for them.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <h4>
                        Social Constructivism and Anthropocentricity </h4>
                    <p>
                        Firstly, Sismondo claims that STS itself is social. I claim this is too anthropocentric and it
                        neglects nature to speak for itself. Some things are best left as “the way it is” and natural
                        explanations are sufficient. We do not need to over complicate things by incorporating human
                        factors.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <h4>
                        The activity of STS
                    </h4>
                    <p>
                        Secondly, Sismondo claims that STS is active. This is true, there is always an active component
                        for driving STS development. However, I disagree when he mentions the heterogenous
                        constructivist nature of STS. I find this problematic and argue that some things cannot be
                        explained from a constructivist standpoint. Quantum mechanics cannot be explained by
                        constructivists, yet we can see the activity of STS in this regard.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <h4>
                        STS, Nature, and Natural Limits
                    </h4>
                    <p>
                        Lastly, Sismondo claims that the products of STS are not natural. I disagree and claim that
                        social constructivism is flawed and incomplete. We can incorporate pragmatic and critical
                        realist ideas to fill the gaps that constructivism has. Only then, we can see that the problems
                        of social constructivism are neglecting nature and predetermined natural limits. As a result,
                        all products of STS must be within natural limits.
                    </p>
