                        <p>
                            This course addresses the ways in which information and information practices are shaping
                            and being shaped by social conflicts, tensions, and alignments. It introduces and integrates
                            issues of representation and knowledge production, privacy and community, autonomy and
                            control, culture and property that are revealed, alleviated, or exacerbated as information
                            practice changes.

                        ASSIGNMENT #3 STORY: The Geopolitics of Google
                    </h3>
                    <p>For the third assignment in INF301, we were tasked to select or come up with a keyword
                        related to information studies. This keyword was to be analyzed and a maximum 2000-word
                        essay. The essay should cover discourse, academic, policy, and public information on the
                        keyword. Students would answer the following questions: </p>
                    <br>

                    <ul>
                        <li>How is the keyword recorded, used and analyzed in scholarly, policy and public debates?
                        </li>
                        <li>How does the keyword open up and make us more conscious about issues and problems
                            related to information in society?</li>
                        <li>What are scholars or policy events associated with the use of the keyword?</li>
                        <li>What are key resources available for further exploration of the keyword?</li>
                    </ul>

                    <br>
                    <h4>
                        Google Inc. and cartography
                    </h4>
                    <p>
                        I chose to write my keyword assignment on the Geopolitics of Google. I define Geopolitics as
                        anything related to changes in political influence as a result of geological factors Maps and
                        Google Earth are examples of geopolitical tools. Mapping has always been inherently
                        geopolitical. Cartographers have always influenced or have been influenced by political factors.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <h4>
                        A world becoming increasingly Googlized
                    </h4>
                    <p>
                        One key idea I will reference frequently is the idea of Googlization. Google has been
                        diversifying its search engine into different contexts, markets, and other applications. Google
                        is not just a search engine. Google is a company that undergoes infrastructure imperialism. A
                        key topic discussed in INF301. As to why they do this, we will look at surveillance capitalism.
                        The user data is the most important asset that Google has. Although Geopolitics, Google Maps,
                        and Google Earth are a small subset of Googlization, they are significant. Google knows what
                        your house looks like, and a general idea of where you live while you use their products.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <h4>
                        Geopolitics of Google through a scholarly lens
                    </h4>
                    <p>
                        Geopolitics has been used in scholarly sources. Google Maps has been generally regarded as a
                        tool. This tool is argued to be one of the technical objects that should be at the forefront of
                        education like mathematics and science.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <h4>
                        Google Maps is inherently political
                    </h4>
                    <p>
                        Google Maps, like any cartographer, is inherently political. We have seen policy influence and
                        been influenced by Google Maps. Google has re-drawn and changed Google Maps as a result of
                        political pressure.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <h4>
                        Google Maps and its geopolitical power
                    </h4>
                    <p>
                        Google Maps has brought attention to unwell documented areas, such as favelas. It brings light
                        to local businesses and a group of people that have never been acknowledged on the international
                        scene. This feeds into Google’s geopolitical power.
