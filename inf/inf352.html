                            Students will develop a general sense of design and the role it plays in the construction of
                            our built environment. Human-centered design practices will be taught. Students will learn
                            to identify important characteristics of the built environment using observational methods
                            drawn from art and design practices, to analyze these characteristics using theories and
                            perspectives drawn from relevant scholarship, and to represent their analyses using
                            techniques of design sketching.

                    <p>The primary sector that we wish to market to is the everyday urban smartphone user. These users
                        are living amongst others in a pandemic. Their urban environment is overrun with news, social
                        media, and information regarding COVID-19. These users need a source of credible information
                        regarding restrictions, guidelines, sources on COVID-19 in their immediate area.

                    <h4>My Role</h4>
                    <p>
                        The COVID-19 idea my first initial proposal to the group members. Personally, I felt that
                        the COVID-19 pandemic has been a part of everyoneâ€™s lives (my peers, their peers, and I)
                        that it warrants us to dive deeper. Alan and I conducted the secondary research during the
                        Discovery phase of our design process. This helped us find intracacies related to our problem
                        of COVID-19 related misinformation.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        During the Ideation phase, I helped group together the following clusters that would
                        be prioritized by our group. Our group voted on the priorities, which resulted in the
                        following priorities (in order of feasibility and impact.
                    </p>
                    <ul>

                            Functionality

                        <li>Credibility</li>
                        <li>Hotspots</li>
                        <li>Personal Assistance</li>
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                    <br>
                    <p>During the Interpretation phase, Alan and I continued to write a summary of our findings from the
                        study we conducted. Additionally, Venkat and I created the affinity diagram using our
                        interviews. This helped us understand the types of things Benjamin would need to have addressed.

                    <p>
                        During the Experimentation, I came up with our hypothesis statements for Benjamin Chen. They are
                        as follows:
                    </p>
                    <ul style="text-align: justify;">
                        <li>We believe that we will achieve a lower percentage of daily local cases if Benjamin Chen
                            can achieve avoiding local hotspots using our COVID hot spot map feature.
                        </li>
                        <li>We believe that we will achieve more awareness of COVID-19 testing locations if
                            Benjamin Chen can achieve booking an appointment nearby using our e-services
                            feature.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            We believe that we will achieve increased participation in safety practices such as
                            social
                            distancing if Benjamin Chen can achieve informing himself on community restrictions
                        </li>
                        <li> We believe that we will achieve better exposure to reliable COVID-19 news and updates
                            if Benjamin Chen can achieve comparing different articles on our app using our COVID19
                            information ranking/comparing feature.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <br>
                    <p>Additionally, I help create the mid-fidelity prototype of InfoCheck.</p>

                    <p>Our methodology for designing InfoCheck was human-centered design (HCD). Every step of the way,
                        we consulted and evaluated our persona, Benjamin Chen. We created affinity diagrams from our
                        research (which included user feedback), empathy maps, needs statements, as-is, and eventual
                        to-be scenarios and put our prototypes to the test with user testing. With user testing, we were
                        able to come out with our medium-fidelity product. Every step in our journey, from an idea to a
                        prototype, had some sort of user justified reasoning to help support us.</p><br>
                    <h4>Tools
                    </h4>
                    <p>With the COVID-19 Pandemic, we were forced to conduct all research, meetings, and work to be
                        online. As a result, most of our team meetings were met over Facebook Messenger and Zoom. Some
                        other tools we used helped us organized our work and ideas.</p>

                    <h4>Skills Developed
                    </h4>
                    <p>Some skills developed with working on this project are quite unique, considering the situation. I
                        have never worked on such a large group project without ever meeting team members before.
                        Additionally, one of our group members lived in a different time zone, which sometimes caused
                        conflicts. As a result, I have learned to be more independent as a team member, as not having
                        someone physcially there to force me do work is important. Another skill I have learned is
                        working in MURAL. Usually when I work, I do not create notes or brainstorm ideas. The MURAL
                        portion of the assignments help me realize the importance of putting ideas down and
                        collaborating with others. Of course, without the pandemic we can do all this without MURAL and
                        have actual sticky notes and white boards.</p> <br>
                    <h4>Lessons Learned
                    </h4>
                    <p>As a result of having a fully online group project, I have learned to be more proactive in taking
                        roles when doing work. Originally, I was not motivated enough to contribute since I have never
                        met anyone face to face in the group. The initial getting to know people over the internet is
                        much more difficult than in person. For me, I need to be comfortable with people. But after this
                        assignment, I have learned sometimes situations are not ideal. I had to adapt, and learn that I
                        need to take more initiative if I want to contribute more to my group.</p><br>
